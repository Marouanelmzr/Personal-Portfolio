            <h2>Internship Project</h2>
            <h4>Founded in 2008, XELOPS Technology (formerly NEOXIA Maroc) is a leading consulting and development company specializing in tailored digital solutions. In June 2025, I had the opportunity to join XELOPS as a Full Stack Developer intern, collaborating closely with one of my schoolmates. During this internship, we designed and developed a custom web application for absence management, enabling the company to efficiently track and manage internsâ€™ leaves. This project combined both front-end and back-end development, focusing on usability, scalability, and seamless integration with their internal processes.</h4>

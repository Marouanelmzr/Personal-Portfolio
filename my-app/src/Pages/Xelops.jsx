            <h2>Internship Project</h2>
            <h4>Founded in 2008, XELOPS Technology (formerly NEOXIA Maroc) is a leading consulting and development company specializing in tailored digital solutions. In June 2025, I had the opportunity to join XELOPS as a Full Stack Developer intern, collaborating closely with one of my schoolmates. During this internship, we designed and developed a custom web application for absence management, enabling the company to efficiently track and manage internsâ€™ leaves. This project combined both front-end and back-end development, focusing on usability, scalability, and seamless integration with their internal processes.</h4>

              <div className='conclusion-content'>
              <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Since this was my first collaborative project, I learned how to use GitHub effectively and manage merge conflicts alongside my teammate.</li>
                  <li>This was also my first internship related to websites (and computer science in general), so gaining insights from our internship supervisor was a valuable experience. We learned to focus not just on aesthetics, but also on usability and performance.</li>
                  <li>I gained my first hands-on experience with SQL databases and authentication systems. I learned how to implement secure login mechanisms and handle large-scale databases efficiently.</li>
                  <li>Working under very tight deadlines taught me to prioritize what matters most: usability, meeting the supervisorâ€™s requirements, and keeping the website simple and functional rather than overly focused on appearance.</li>
                </ul>
              <h4>What I Would Do Differently</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>With more time, I could have improved the micro-interactions, such as animations for filters and dropdowns.</li>
                <li>I should have spent more time on research and gathered feedback from actual employees to better align the features with user needs.</li>
                <li>I could have added more precision to absence submissions, such as supporting half days off at the start and end of each absence.</li>
                <li>I would have implemented Docker containers to ensure the application was easily deployable and consistently accessible across different operating systems. This would have mitigated compatibility issues, particularly for MacBook users, and streamlined both testing and deployment processes.</li>
              </ul>
